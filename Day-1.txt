computer - electronic device which takes raw data as input process it and returns us information as output.
         computer has no self intelligence ,

program - set of instrictions/cpmmand written in specific order

programming language - a process of writing a program through which we will be communicating with machine/computer/cpu
                       High Level 
                       Low level language ( Machine Language,assembly language)


 Low level- It is also known as machine language
           pro: since it is written in binary it will be directly executed by cpu so it is fast
          cons : difficult to learn,diffult to debug, take more time to write a code


HLL - These are english like language which can be easily understood by programmer.
      JAVA is a HLL.
      pros:easy to code,easy to debug, more functionality with lesser code.           
     
      cons: we need a compiler/interpreter to convert this code to binary/ML
            It is slow compare to Binary Language/LLL

Compiler :- Its primary task is to compile HLL into MLL( it will convert entire code into single go/run)
             faster 
Interpretor - convert HLL into MLL(it will interprete line by line)
              cons- slow compare to compiler


 Reserved Keywords -(3)These are predefined words but does not contains a meaningful functionality.
                      true
                      false
                      null
 Keywords: These are predefined words that contains a meaningful functionality. there are 50 Keywords in Java ( goto,const)

            Keywords for premitive data type :-8
            bytes,short,int,long,float,double,char,boolean

            Keywords for control flow :-11
            if,else,for,do,while,switch,case,break,continue,default,return

           Keywords for modifiers:-11
           public,protected,private,static,final,abstract,synchronised,native,transient,volatile,strictfp(java1.2)

           Keywords for exception handling :-6
           try,catch,throw,throws,finally,assert

           Keywords related to class concepts  :-7
           class,interface,enum(java1.5),extends,implements,import,package

           keywords related to objects:-4
           this,super,instanceof,return
       
           Keywords related to return type :
           void

 NoTE- all the keywords/reserved keywords are in lower case and these are case sensitive


JDK : Java Development KIt it contains everything that will be required to develop and run a java application
      JDK= JRE+ Libraries required to develop Java application

JRE : It contains everyrhing reqired to run a java application which has been compiled already.
     JRE = JVM + Libraries to run application

JVM : Java Virtual Machine whch sits on the top of CPU, it will only work with bytecode


public static void main (string args[])

public:- it is an access modifier who can accessed from anywhere(outside the package,class)
static:- it menas the given method is not object related but class related.it can be accessed without creating an object/instance of a class
void: it is a return type ,and void means it will not return anything
main: It is name of a method,This method is a starting point for JVM
string args:It is the parameter to the main method ,and arguement could be anything

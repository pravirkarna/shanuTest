			it can be father--child
          		grandfather--father--child---

	4) Abstraction - show only relevant data
			1)interface - using interface multiple inheritance is possible.
					it is simple java class where all methods are abstract.
                                        all variable by default will be static and final.
                                       inteface can not have objects 
				an interface can extend only interface (can not extend class)
				when we want 100% of abstraction we go for an interface.
                                   note: interface can extend another inteface using extends keyword
                                        a class can implement interface using implements keyword


			2)Abstract class - It is like a simple class but it can not be instantiated(can not have object)
                                           It can have abstract method as well as concrete(generalo or simple) method.
                                           when we want to achieve partial abstraction we go for abstract class.
					an abstract class can extend only one class or abstract class
